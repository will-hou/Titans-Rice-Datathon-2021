AS THE POPULATION AGES, SO THE PREVALENCE OF LONG-TERM CONDITIONS INCREASES, WHICH PRESENTS SUBSTANTIAL CHALLENGES TO PROVIDERS OF HEALTH AND SOCIAL CARE. THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES HOW TELEMONITORING COULD HELP TO MEET SOME OF THESE CHALLENGES. TELEMONITORING INVOLVES PATIENTS AT HOME RECORDING VITAL SIGNS, FOR EXAMPLE, BLOOD PRESSURE AND PULSE, AND TRANSMITTING THIS INFORMATION ELECTRONICALLY TO NURSES BASED ELSEWHERE. NURSES CAN THEN USE THESE DATA TO IDENTIFY SIGNS OF DETERIORATION, INTERVENE PROMPTLY AND PREVENT ADMISSION TO HOSPITAL. THERE IS SOME EVIDENCE THAT THIS FORM OF CARE IS POPULAR WITH PATIENTS AND CAN IMPROVE CLINICAL OUTCOMES. HOWEVER, NURSES SHOULD ENSURE THAT THEY UNDERSTAND THE OPPORTUNITIES AND DIFFICULTIES PRESENTED BY TELEMONITORING, DEVELOP THE SKILLS NECESSARY TO USE IT EFFECTIVELY AND PUT THEMSELVES AT THE FOREFRONT OF THIS INNOVATIVE METHOD OF SUPPORTING CARE PROVISION.",,,"BARRETT, D.; FACULTY OF HEALTH AND SOCIAL CARE, UNIVERSITY OF HULLUNITED KINGDOM; EMAIL: D.I.BARRETT@HULL.AC.UK",ARTICLE,10.7748/nop2012.09.24.7.21.c9257,,14720795,NURSING OLDER PEOPLE,ENGLISH,9,7,,21-25,RCN PUBLISHING COMPANY LTD.,23008916,SCOPUS,THE ROLE OF TELEMONITORING IN CARING FOR OLDER PEOPLE WITH LONG-TERM CONDITIONS,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84868232268&doi=10.7748%2fnop2012.09.24.7.21.c9257&partnerID=40&md5=e4b7fdcff033e77aed0c9dcaec2088ea,24,2012,UNIVERSITY OF HULL,NOTREPORTED;UNIVERSITY OF HULLUNITED KINGDOM;NOTREPORTED,,"BARRETT D, 2012, NURS OLDER PEOPLE","BARRETT D, 2012, NURS OLDER PEOPLE"

HOWEVER, THREE RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN EUROPE AND THE U.K. WILL CHANGE THESE TRADITIONAL PRACTICES.

COMMUN. NETW.,"THE CONTINUED, UBIQUITOUS GROWTH OF THE INTERNET COUPLED WITH INCREASED COMPUTER PENETRATION IN HOUSEHOLDS HAS RAISED THE EXPECTATIONS FOR CONSUMERS AND SOCIETY TO REAP THE BENEFITS OF THE 'E-SOCIETY': INCREASING ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE THROUGH TELEMEDICINE; DIMINISHING THE SOCIAL DIVIDE THROUGH TELE-EDUCATION; AND INCREASING THE QUALIFY OF LIFE, AND COMPETITIVENESS OF THE ECONOMY THROUGH TELEWORK. ALTHOUGH THESE POTENTIAL BENEFITS WOULD ACCRUE UNIVERSALLY TO ALL COUNTRIES, THE GROWTH OF BROADBAND ACCESS WHICH WOULD FACILITATE THESE APPLICATIONS HAS BEEN VARIED ACROSS DIFFERENT COUNTRIES. THIS PAPER ARGUES THAT THE VARIED RATES OF ADOPTION ARE ATTRIBUTABLE, IN PART, TO THE AGGRESSIVE GOVERNMENT POLICIES TO DEPLOY BROADBAND NETWORKS AND TO ENCOURAGE THE USE OF THESE APPLICATIONS. GOVERNMENTS ARE MOTIVATED TO DEPLOY BROADBAND NETWORKS TO ACHIEVE COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE IN THE GLOBAL PRODUCTION PROCESS, AS WELL AS TO ALLEVIATE SOME OF THE MAJOR SOCIETAL CHALLENGES. THIS IS ESPECIALLY TRUE FOR THE ASIAN ECONOMIES OF SINGAPORE, SOUTH KOREA AND MALAYSIA. INDEPENDENT OF DIRECT GOVERNMENT POLICIES, THE AVAILABILITY OF CONTENT THAT EXPLOITS THE CULTURAL HAPPENSTANCE OF A COUNTRY, AS EVIDENT FROM NTT'S DOCOMO EXPERIENCE, IS ANOTHER STRONG FACTOR EXPLAINING THE DIFFERENCE IN BROADBAND DEPLOYMENT RATES. HOWEVER, EVEN IF ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL BENEFITS EXIST, AS IN THE CASE OF TELEMEDICINE IN THE UNITED STATES, CULTURAL AND SOCIAL FACTORS MAY IN FACT HINDER THE DEPLOYMENT OF SUCH APPLICATIONS AND RETARD THE GROWTH RATE OF BROADBAND ACCESS.",,,"FIFE, E.; CTR.

IN THIS CONTEXT, IT BECOMES ESSENTIAL TO DEVELOP METHODS AND TECHNIQUES FOR A BETTER AND MORE NATURAL INTERACTION WITH THESE DEVICES. IN THIS ARTICLE, WE ADDRESS THE PROBLEM OF GESTURE SEGMENTATION AND RECOGNITION, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE LIMITED COMPUTATIONAL RESOURCES OF SMARTPHONE DEVICES. WE INTRODUCE A METHODOLOGY FOR DESIGNING EFFICIENT AND USEFUL APPLICATIONS THAT, BY USING LOW-COST AND WIDELY DIFFUSED TECHNOLOGIES, CAN BE USED IN TELEMEDICINE, HOME-BASED REHABILITATION, AND OTHER BIOMEDICAL APPLICATIONS FOR PATIENTS WITH SPECIFIC DISABILITIES. TO THIS END, WE HAVE DESIGNED A NEW MACHINE-LEARNING ALGORITHM THAT IS ABLE TO IDENTIFY HAND GESTURES THROUGH THE USE OF HU IMAGE MOMENTS, DUE TO THEIR INVARIANCE TO ROTATION, TRANSLATION, SCALING, AND THEIR LOW COMPUTATIONAL COST. THE EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS COLLECTED FROM A CASE STUDY SHOW AN EXCELLENT GESTURE RECOGNITION PERFORMANCE AND AN AFFORDABLE REAL-TIME EXECUTION SPEED ON SMARTPHONES AND OTHER MOBILE DEVICES. 2018 IEEE.",8570908,,,ARTICLE,10.1109/MCE.2018.2868109,,21622248,IEEE CONSUMER ELECTRONICS MAGAZINE,ENGLISH,3,1,,25-29,INSTITUTE OF ELECTRICAL AND ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC.,,SCOPUS,A SMARTPHONE-BASED APPLICATION USING MACHINE LEARNING FOR GESTURE RECOGNITION: USING FEATURE EXTRACTION AND TEMPLATE MATCHING VIA HU IMAGE MOMENTS TO RECOGNIZE GESTURES,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85058326507&doi=10.1109%2fMCE.2018.2868109&partnerID=40&md5=790c85e52b2dc218b5b2cf006c0f7ea6,8,2019,UNIVERSITY OF ROME LA SAPIENZA;UNIVERSITY OF ROME LA SAPIENZA,UNIVERSITY OF ROME LA SAPIENZA;UNIVERSITY OF ROME LA SAPIENZA,,"PANELLA M, 2019, IEEE CONSUM ELECTRON MAG","PANELLA M, 2019, IEEE CONSUM ELECTRON MAG"

HOWEVER, THIS EFFECTIVE TREATMENT IS STILL POORLY UTILISED IN RURAL AREAS WHERE THERE IS A SHORTAGE OF STROKE SPECIALISTS REQUIRED FOR SAFE THROMBOLYSIS. DUE TO LONG TRAVEL TIMES FROM RURAL HOSPITALS TO STROKE CENTRES OFFERING THROMBOLYSIS, RURAL PATIENTS OFTEN FAIL TO PRESENT WITHIN THE 4.5 HOUR ELIGIBILITY WINDOW FOR THROMBOLYSIS. FURTHERMORE, THE DELAY IN RECEIVING THROMBOLYSIS IS ASSOCIATED WITH MORE RESULTANT DISABILITY, AS TIME TO TREATMENT IS CRITICAL IN DETERMINING FUNCTIONAL OUTCOME. ""TELESTROKE,"" THE APPLICATION OF TELEMEDICINE IN ASSESSMENT AND MANAGEMENT OF ACUTE STROKE PATIENTS, IS ONE SOLUTION TO COMBAT THE RURAL-METROPOLITAN STROKE CARE DISPARITY. THESE SYSTEMS UTILISE REAL-TIME VIDEOCONFERENCING TECHNOLOGY TO PROVIDE STROKE SPECIALIST GUIDANCE FOR RURAL CLINICIANS INEXPERIENCED IN ACUTE STROKE CARE AND INCREASE RURAL ACCESSIBILITY OF THROMBOLYSIS. BOTH SITE-DEPENDENT AND MOBILE WEB-BASED TELESTROKE SYSTEMS ARE ALREADY IN PLACE OVERSEAS AND HAVE DEMONSTRATED SAFETY, DIAGNOSTIC ACCURACY AND IMPROVEMENT IN LONG-TERM FUNCTIONAL OUTCOMES.

IN THE AMBULATORY SETTING, FOR EXAMPLE, BETWEEN 1.5% AND 4.0% PF PRESCRIPTIONS ARE IN ERROR WITH POTENTIALLY SERIOUS RISK TO PATIENTS. ACCORDING TO A 2005 FDA REPORT, MEDICATION ERRORS RESULT IN AT LEAST ONE DEATH PER DAY AND 1.3 MILLION INJURIES PER YEAR IN THE UNITED STATES. INPATIENTS WHO ARE GIVEN WRONG MEDICATIONS AVERAGE AN ADDITIONAL 12 DAYS IN LENGTH-OF-STAY. TECHNOLOGY ANABLES HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO CARRY OUT REPETITIOUS AND ROUTINE MECHANICAL PROCESSES IN BOTH THE AMBULATORY AND INPATIENT PHARMACY SETTING. AUTOMATED PHARMACY PROCESSES FEATURE MUCH HIGHER PRECISION AND LOWER ERROR RATES THAN CAN BE ACHIEVED BY HUMANS, THEREBY REDUCING MEDICATION ERRORS, IMPROVING QUALITY, AND FREEING UP THE PHARMACIST FOR MORE PRODUCTIVE CLINICAL INTERACTIONS WITH PATIENTS. THROUGH THE USE OF INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONS, PHARMACISTS CAN INCREASE THEIR OVERSIGHT OF CLINICAL PROCESSES DURING PRESCRIPTION PREPARATION AND DISPENSING, WHILE AT THE SAME TIME MAKING MORE EFFICIENT USE OF THEIR OVERALL PROFESSIONAL TIME. ONE MAJOR CLASS OF TECHNOLOGY ENABLES WITH THE POTENTIAL TO REDUCE MEDICATION ERRORS IS HEALTH INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY, WHICH WAS RECENTLY REVIEWED. OTHER MAJOR CLASSES OF TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONS INCLUDE ROBOTICS, BAR CODING AND RADIO FREQUENCY IDENTIFICATION (RFID), AUTOMATED CALCULATION OF DOSES AND DILUTIONS, DIGITAL IMAGING, TELEPHARMACY, AND NONINVASIVE VERIFICATION OF CAPSULE CONTENTS USING SPATIALLY OFFSET RAMAN SPECTROSCOPY (SORS).

THE PROGRAMME, WHICH UNDERPINS ACTION SIX OF NHS ENGLAND'S TEN-POINT PLAN FOR GENERAL PRACTICE NURSING, SHOWS THAT A 'GROUND-UP' APPROACH TO UPSKILL AND EMPOWER FRONT-LINE CLINICIANS IS CENTRAL TO EMBEDDING TECHNOLOGY-ENABLED CARE SERVICES (TECS). FOLLOWING COMPLETION OF THE ACTION LEARNING SETS (ALSS), 24 GENERAL PRACTICE NURSING DIGITAL CHAMPIONS ACROSS STAFFORDSHIRE HAVE USED TECS TO DELIVER A RANGE OF BENEFITS FOR THEIR PRACTICE TEAMS. THIS HAS INFORMED THE INTRODUCTION AND EXTENSION OF THE PROGRAMME, WITH NATIONAL FUNDING FOR A FURTHER 12 REGIONAL PILOT ALSS ACROSS ENGLAND IN 2018-19. IMPORTANTLY, THE ACTIVE LEARNING INDIVIDUALISED APPROACH PROVIDES A DIGITALLY READY WORKFORCE WITH THE ABILITY AND SUPPORT TO ADOPT TECS IN AREAS OF CLINICAL NEED.
